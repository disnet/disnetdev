In my reading for UCOR today I ran across something I had been told once but forgotten. Turns out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Augustine">St. Augustine</a> rejected biblical literalism. Specifically in regards to creation, he believed that God created the world instantly and that the days were representative of a "logical framework" not an actual time period.

We present a method to support the gradual evolution of secure
scripts by formalizing an extension of the simply-typed lambda
calculus that provides information flow constructs. These constructs
allow initially insecure programs to evolve via targeted refactoring
and to provide dynamic information flow guarantees via casts, as well
as static information flow guarantees via labeled types.

Hi! I'm Tim Disney. I write code and things.

I mostly work on programming languages and web security (we *do* have to be better at the cyber).

I am against fascists.

If you'd like to talk to me, I'm [@disnet](https://twitter.com/disnet) on twitter and `tim@disnet.me` on email.

## Some stuff I made

- [Sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org): Scheme/Racket-style hygienic macros for JavaScript.
- Hygienic Macros for JavaScript: my doctoral dissertation on Sweet.js.
- [Contracts.coffee](http://disnetdev.com/contracts.coffee/): Scheme/Racket-style higher-order contracts for CoffeeScript. No longer maintained but it was fun experiment.

Hi! I'm Tim Disney. I write code and things.

I mostly work on programming languages and web security (we have to be better at the cyber).

I am against fascists.

If you'd like to talk to me, I'm [@disnet](https://twitter.com/disnet) on twitter and `tim@disnet.me` on email.

## Some stuff I made

I'm [@disnet](https://github.com/disnet) on GitHub.

- [Sweet.js](http://sweetjs.org): hygienic macros for JavaScript.
- [Contracts.coffee](http://disnetdev.com/contracts.coffee/): higher-order contracts for CoffeeScript. No longer maintained but it was fun experiment.

## Some papers I wrote

The highlights. There are [others](/papers).

- [Hygienic Macros for JavaScript](/static/papers/thesis.pdf): my doctoral dissertation showing how to adapt a hygienic macros system to JavaScript.
- [Game Semantics for Type Soundness](/papers/game-semantics-for-type-soundness) (LICS 2015): using a pi-calculus like formulation of game semantics to do type soundness proofs.
- [Virtual Values for Language Extension](/papers/virtual-values-for-language-extension) (OOPSLA 2011): a generalization and formalization of existing meta-object systems with a particular application for JavaScript.
- [Temporal Higher-Order Contracts](/papers/temporal-higher-order-contracts) (ICFP 2011): bringing temporal assertions to higher-order contracts.

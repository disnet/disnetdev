Iâ€™m beginning to suspect Elon Musk is deliberately trolling us. 

[Adding games to his car](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/elon-musk-to-video-game-devs-help-me-put-super-fun-games-on-tesla-screens/)? An obviously bad idea guaranteed to get a rise out of people. 

Unironically [praising BioShock](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1024760547059818497?s=21), a game that ([ostensibly](https://twitter.com/Campster/status/1024806013004926978)) critiques men like Musk? Setting up an easy and obvious dunk is a classic troll move.

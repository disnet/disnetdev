[Four days trapped at sea with crypto’s nouveau riche](https://breakermag.com/trapped-at-sea-with-cryptos-nouveau-riche/)

Absolutely crazy story about cyptocurrency in 2018. 

> [the welcome gift bags] contain painkillers, Alka-Seltzer, several condoms, the  world’s flimsiest pregnancy test, and a half-bottle of Jägermeister. It’s the kind  of thing you’d leave at the bottom of the chimney for Skeezy Uncle Santa,  hoping he’ll stuff a new sex doll under your tree.

The obvious take is that cypto is full of truly awful people but it also got me thinking about how cynical I’ve become. Not that I want my mind to be as “open” as these crypto-hucksters but still. There’s something somewhat inspiring about folks so excited about the potential of the future.

Some of them anyways, fuck McAffee obviously.

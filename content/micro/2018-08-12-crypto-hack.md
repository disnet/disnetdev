[Responsible disclosure in the era of cryptocurrencies](https://medium.com/mit-media-lab-digital-currency-initiative/http-coryfields-com-cash-48a99b85aad4)

Crazy story about trying to responsibly disclose a bug in Bitcoin Cash that might have erased billions in value.

The traditional technology world has had years to get security and disclosure figured out (and still does it badly all the time). The cryptocurrency world is being forced to mature in an incredibly short amount of time. I'm frankly surprised more catastrophes like this haven't happened yet.

[Decentralized Systems Aren't](https://blog.dshr.org/2024/04/decentralized-systems-arent.html)

Centralized systems will always layer on top of decentralized systems unless you figure out how to fix the underlying economic problem of increasing returns to scale.

- a business model that has _decreasing_ returns to scale
- a way to prevent Sybil attacks without massive cost
- a way to prevent collusion between independent nodes

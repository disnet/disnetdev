[Zed now predicts your next edit with Zeta, our new open model](https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction)

Played around with Zed's edit prediction feature today and it worked surprisly well.

I like this feature because it sits on the spectrum betwen "just chat with Claude" on the one hand and "describe what Cursor should do" on the other. It augments your process rather than trying to do it entirely.

Side note: it sounds like the voice over in their video is an AI voice and I really don't like it. I don't understand why they did that, I would much prefer to hear their "unprofessional" developer voices.

[Large AI Models Are Cultural and Social Technologies](https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/large-ai-models-are-cultural-and). The way LLMs are often framed is as "intelligent agents" but maybe this is the wrong framing. Rather we should view them as "cultural and social technologies" (like the printing press or markets) that are "allowing humans to take advantage of information other humans have accumulated".

Not as snappy or exciting in a science fiction sort of way but more accurate without being dismissive of their impact on society.

Chrome can now run [contracts.coffee](http://disnetdev.com/contracts.coffee/)!
I've been waiting a while for the proxy support in Chrome to get far enough along but
it's finally here. 

Chrome hides experimental JavaScript features
like proxies behind flags so you'll need to go to 
about:flags and enable the experimental JavaScript flag.

Try it out and if you run into any issues let me know on 
[github](https://github.com/disnet/contracts.coffee/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open).

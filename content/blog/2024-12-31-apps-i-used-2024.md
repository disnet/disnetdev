**Browser**: [Arc](https://arc.net/)

Still a transformative browser UX but I'm worried about its future considering their recent pivot to a new "AI first" browser. We'll see how things go in 2025.

**Notes**: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

Continues to [run my life](https://www.disnetdev.com/blog/2023-07-09-using-obsidian/).

**Read it Later**: [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read)

Still the best thing ever. I have highlights sync to Obsidian, which is the best thing ever.

**Task Management**: [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/)

I tried to switch to Things last year but it didn't stick. Back to OmniFocus and it's great although the v4 update was a bit rough but it's mostly evened out now.

**Code Editor**: [Zed](https://zed.dev/) 

Zed is incredible. Fast, great VIM mode, AI integration is great (though I need to check out [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) at some point too).

**AI Assistant**: [Claude](https://claude.ai/) 

This was the year I started to actually get productive with AI assistants. They aren’t always good but when they are they really are. I mostly use Claude at this point though I don’t really do extensive comparisons.

**Launcher**: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

A bunch of my one-off AI assistants use is actually via Raycast. Super helpful to have it always a keystroke away. 

**Calendar**: [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) 

Continues to be great.

**Podcasts**: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) 

Continues to be great

**Email**: Mail.app

Boring but I’ve come around on that being what I like out of email.

**Finance**: [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) 

Continues to be great.

title: Some of the Apps I used in 2023
---

- Browser: [Arc](https://arc.net/) (it's soooo good, love the clever rethinking of tabs)
- Notes: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (it's now [running my life](https://www.disnetdev.com/blog/2023-07-09-using-obsidian/), so so good. I'd tried so many solutions over the years, this one is really sticking)
- Read it later: [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) (basically what I've wanted for years, captures everything, handles article processing workflows like I want, syncs highlights to Obsidian)
- Task Management: [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) (switched from OmniFocus after > 10 years, OF 4 was not sparking joy)
- Code: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (meh, it's fine)
- LLM for coding: [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) (I find it hit or miss, but scary neat when it hits)
- Task Launcher: [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) (its ChatGPT integration is pretty great)
- Mastodon Client: [Ivory](https://tapbots.com/ivory/) (for iPhone, love the feel) and [Elk](https://elk.zone/) (for desktop Web, love the threading of conversations)
- Calendar: [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) (continues to be great)
- Podcasts: [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) (continues to be great)
- Email: [Fastmail](https://app.fastmail.com/) (great, starting to move from gmail), [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) (meh, slightly better than Mail.app)
- Finance: [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) (continues to be great)
- RSS Reader: [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) and [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) (good apps but my RSS consumption is sporadic)

[Never Forgive Them](https://www.wheresyoured.at/never-forgive-them/):

> I will never forgive these people for what they’ve done to the computer, and the more I learn about both their intentions and actions the more certain I am that they are unrepentant and that their greed will never be sated. I have watched them take the things that made me human — social networking, digital communities, apps, and the other connecting fabric of our digital lives — and turned them into devices of torture, profitable mechanisms of abuse, and find it disgusting how many reporters seem to believe it's their responsibility to thank them and explain why it's good this is happening to their readers.

Last year Ed Zitron became my favorite critic of the tech industry's rot. He's incisive and angry and it's cathartic to read him.

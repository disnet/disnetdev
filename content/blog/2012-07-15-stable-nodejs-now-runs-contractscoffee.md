Took almost a year but now the stable version of node.js (0.8.0+) has
a recent enough version of V8 to run contracts.coffee! The much
needed proxy support is still behind a flag so you'll need to
supply `--harmony_proxies` and `--harmony-collections` as usual.

Also, the latest version of contracts.coffee (0.3.1) 
and is now up on npm and
collects a few bugs fixes.

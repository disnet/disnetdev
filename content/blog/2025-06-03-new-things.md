Big changes happening in my life. After almost a decade, today was my last day working at Shape Security / F5.

It was a really good run. I had the chance to work with incredible folks building wild things on the web and I think we make it a little safer and more convenient for everyone.

Now it's time for something completely different. Not entirely sure what that is yet but I'll figure out something fun soon.
